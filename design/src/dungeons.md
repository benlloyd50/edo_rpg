# Dungeons 
Dungeons will offer a unique challenge to players who are willing to have a go. They will have certain entry items needed before entry is permitted.
They will contain powerful loot only available to strong enough and skilled players.

## Use Case
**Actors**: player
- I want to go into a dungeon and be challenged by puzzles and unique monster battles
- I want to be rewarded immensely for how well I do in the dungeon

## Gameplay
### Score
Score will be determined depending on how the player performs during the game. If they perform the duties required for the puzzle or
defeat the monsters they will be rewarded "dungeon points". These points will be tallied at the end of the dungeon and will decide
the loot rewarded for completing the dungeon.

## Limitations
None as of now
